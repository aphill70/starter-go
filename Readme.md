Download this repo and open main.go inside a text editor. You need to add code to 3 places to complete the functions.

The function `isOldest` needs a few if statements to print the correct statement based on the scout passed in.

To test this function:
```bash
 go run main.go oldest <name>
```

The next function `birthday` needs a few if statements and a variable assignment to print the correct birthday based on the scout.

To test this function:
```bash
go run main.go birthday <name>
```

the final function `age` takes an argument for the operation to use so you need to use an if statement to choose the correct math operation and then assign the result to the result variable.

To test this function:
```bash
go run main.go age -sum
go run main.go age -average
go run main.go age -product
```

```bash
go run main.go birthday <name>
```
